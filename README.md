# muscle_lncRNA
This is a temporary storage for list of Age-lncRNAs found in muscle.

There are 62 lncRNA sequences in the zip folder named "bkp_raw_sequence_json.zip". 
However a few lncRNA sequence information was not available in the databse. They still exist as dependent files, but until information is collected they are not suitable for further analysis. I will try to fill the gap as soon as possible.

RNA-sequence was retrieved from the ENSEMBLE website using API.
